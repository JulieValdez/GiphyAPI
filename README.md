# GiphyAPI

this is a homework assignment for my full stack bootcamp class.
Design a page that will dynamically populate the html with buttons and divs to hold gif images
Get an API key from GIPHY API to be able to use to call a limited amount of gifs to your page based on a list of analagous topic.
also have an input so users can add there own topics to your script and it will continue to add to the buttons that can be used to call the gifs
when the user clicks on a topic button it will produce 10 gifs in static form, that the user can click on to change to an animated gif and then click to change back to static.
